# MNIST-CNN
Digit recognition neural network using the MNIST dataset. 
This is an extension (that has been recoded from near scratch) of my prior network.
The basic network is complete, though poorly documented. The convolution and pooling features are currently broken, though.
With the addition of RMSprop the project now has accuracy levels around 95%.
